## DevOps Lab 4 – Hosting using GitHub Pages  
[https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/ShriRadhey-Mishra.github.io.git]

When we have created a repository, we can host either its HTML content or the README markdown page on GitHub Pages, just by following these simple steps:

1. Write a markdown or an HTML which you want to be hosted.  
2. Push it to the repository whose content you want to host.  
3. Go to the settings in that repository and then select GitHub Pages.  
4. Select “Deploy from Branch” in the source section (selected by default).  
5. Then in the branch section, select the branch and save.  
6. Now in the custom domain, link your GitHub repository’s location and save.  

You’ll see a “Your site is live at: <source_location>”, where you’ll either see the HTML or the markdown file’s content.

Using GitHub Pages, we can simply host any repository we want.
